# Development Notes

Common development workflow issues, their root causes, and solutions.
Updated as new issues are encountered during development.

---

## 1. Prettier Format Check Failing in CI

**Symptom:**
```
[warn] some-file.js
[warn] Code style issues found in N files. Run Prettier with --write to fix.
Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
```

**Root cause:** Code written manually (typed by hand) does not always match
Prettier's exact formatting expectations — indentation, quote style, trailing
commas, line length, semicolons. Even a single extra space triggers a failure.
CI runs Prettier in `--check` mode, which fails on any deviation without fixing it.

**Solution:** Always run Prettier with `--write` before committing:
```bash
npm run format
```
Then stage the reformatted files and commit. The CI format check will pass cleanly.

**Prevention:** Make `npm run format` the first step before every `git add`.
Never commit without running it first.

## 2. ESLint `no-undef` Errors for CAP Query Globals

**Symptom:**
```
error  'SELECT' is not defined  no-undef
error  'UPDATE' is not defined  no-undef
```

**Root cause:** CAP injects `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `UPSERT`
into the JavaScript global scope at runtime. ESLint performs static analysis
and never sees the runtime — it flags them as undefined variables.

**Solution:** Declare them as known globals in `eslint.config.js`. See `cap-notes.md §4`
for the exact configuration.

## 3. Local PostgreSQL Setup & Schema Migration (EPIC23-T1)

The project uses SQLite in-memory (`:memory:`) for local development and CI — zero setup, but data
never persists and there is no schema-evolution history. Production (`NODE_ENV=production` / the
`[production]` cds profile, `package.json`) is configured for PostgreSQL via `@cap-js/postgres`
instead (`"db": {"kind": "postgres"}` under `cds.requires.[production]`).

**Running against a real local PostgreSQL** (to test the production DB config before deploying):

```bash
# Any local PostgreSQL 14+ works. Example via Docker:
docker run --name automarket-pg -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=devpw -e POSTGRES_DB=automarket -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:16

# Point cds at it (local override, never commit real credentials — see EPIC23-T6
# for the full environment-variable story):
export NODE_ENV=production
export CDS_REQUIRES_DB_CREDENTIALS_HOST=localhost
export CDS_REQUIRES_DB_CREDENTIALS_PORT=5432
export CDS_REQUIRES_DB_CREDENTIALS_DATABASE=automarket
export CDS_REQUIRES_DB_CREDENTIALS_USER=postgres
export CDS_REQUIRES_DB_CREDENTIALS_PASSWORD=devpw
```

**Schema deployment — no hand-written migration files.** `@cap-js/postgres` brings its own schema
evolution mechanism (the same one used for SAP HANA), tracked in a `cds_model` table it creates
itself — not a `db/migrations/*.sql` folder maintained by hand. Deviates from the original backlog
wording ("create `db/migrations/` with an initial schema migration script"), confirmed with the
user before implementing:

```bash
# One-time, first deployment only — creates cds_model (the schema-evolution
# baseline) and the full initial schema from the current CDS model:
npx cds deploy --model-only
npx cds deploy

# Every subsequent deployment (after a CDS model change) — compares the
# current model against cds_model and applies only the delta (ALTER TABLE
# etc.), not a drop-and-recreate:
npx cds deploy
```

To preview the SQL a deploy would run without touching any database (useful for reviewing a schema
change before applying it, or for generating a one-off reference snapshot):

```bash
npx cds deploy --to postgres --dry
```

**Not yet verified against a real running PostgreSQL instance** — this sandbox has no `docker`/local
`postgres` available, so only the `[production]` cds config resolution was confirmed
(`npx cds env get requires.db --profile production` correctly resolves `kind: postgres`,
`schema_evolution: auto`, `impl: @cap-js/postgres`). The actual `cds deploy --model-only` / `cds
deploy` flow against a live PostgreSQL should be run at least once before this is considered
production-ready — flagged here rather than silently assumed to work.

## 4. BTP XSUAA Service Binding Procedure (EPIC23-T2)

`xs-security.json` (scopes, role templates, role collections for Admin/Manager/Operator/Customer —
EPIC02-T8) describes the XSUAA service instance's *configuration*, but doesn't create or bind
anything by itself. On Cloud Foundry, this is a three-step process using the `cf` CLI:

```bash
# 1. Create the XSUAA service instance from xs-security.json (one-time, or
#    whenever xs-security.json changes — re-run "cf update-service" instead):
cf create-service xsuaa application automarket-xsuaa -c xs-security.json

# 2. Bind it to the deployed application (makes its credentials available
#    to the app via VCAP_SERVICES at startup — no manual credential copying):
cf bind-service automarket automarket-xsuaa

# 3. Restage so the app picks up the new binding:
cf restage automarket
```

After `xs-security.json` changes (e.g. adding/removing a scope or attribute), update the existing
instance instead of recreating it:

```bash
cf update-service automarket-xsuaa -c xs-security.json
```

**Assigning users to roles** happens in the BTP cockpit (Security → Role Collections), not via the
`cf` CLI: for each of the four `role-collections` in `xs-security.json`
(`AutoMarket_Admin`/`AutoMarket_Manager`/`AutoMarket_Operator`/`AutoMarket_Customer`), assign it to
the relevant user. For `AutoMarket_Manager`/`AutoMarket_Operator`, the cockpit's role-collection
assignment screen will additionally prompt for the `branchId` attribute value (wired via
`attribute-references` on those two role templates, see cap-notes.md #20's fix — without that, there
would be no field to set it in) — this becomes `req.user.attr.branchId` in every branch-scoped
handler, the production equivalent of the mocked auth users' `attr.branchId` in `package.json`.

**A real, confirmed gap found while testing this, not assumed to be fine because the JSON
validated:** starting the app locally with `NODE_ENV=production` set (no real XSUAA binding, just
checking the auth *code path* actually runs) crashed immediately with
`Cannot find '@sap/xssec'` — the library `@sap/cds`'s xsuaa auth strategy needs at runtime was never
installed, and nothing in `npm install`/`npm test`/CI ever exercises the `[production]` auth profile
to catch this (see cap-notes.md #20 for the full story). Fixed with `npm install --save @sap/xssec`;
re-running then failed with the *expected* `no XSUAA instance bound to application` error instead —
confirming the config is correctly wired and just needs an actual BTP binding (steps above) to work
end to end.

## 5. Local docker-compose Integration (EPIC23-T4)

`docker-compose.yml` runs the app container against a real, containerized PostgreSQL — not the
`[production]` profile (which also requires a real XSUAA binding docker-compose can't provide
locally), but a separate `[hybrid]` cds profile (`package.json`, `cds.requires.[hybrid]`) that
activates PostgreSQL while keeping `auth.kind: mocked` (the default users, unchanged). This is a
local-integration-testing topology, not a production deployment shape — no XSUAA, one container, no
approuter in front.

**First run:**

```bash
cp .env.example .env          # then edit POSTGRES_PASSWORD to something real
make up                        # docker compose up -d --build
make db-init                   # one-time: cds deploy --model-only, then cds deploy
```

After `make db-init`, the app is fully usable at `http://localhost:4004` with real persisted
PostgreSQL data (the same mocked-auth users as always — `admin.mueller@automarkt.de` / `Test@1234`
etc.). `make down` stops the containers; the PostgreSQL data volume (`automarket-pg-data`) survives
a `down`/`up` cycle — only `docker compose down -v` wipes it, at which point `make db-init` needs to
run again.

**A subtle risk checked, not assumed safe:** `docker-compose.yml` supplies PostgreSQL credentials
via `CDS_REQUIRES_DB_CREDENTIALS_{HOST,PORT,DATABASE,USER,PASSWORD}` environment variables (CAP's
standard env-var-to-config mapping — confirmed working via `npx cds env get requires.db`, which
correctly populated `credentials.host`/`port`/`user`/`password`/`database` from those exact env var
names). The base (non-hybrid) `db` config's `credentials.url: ':memory:'` (SQLite) is still present
underneath the merged config once those env vars are added — checked whether that stale leftover
`url` field could confuse the `pg` driver into trying to parse it as a connection string: it can't.
`@cap-js/postgres` passes the whole `credentials` object straight to `pg`'s `Client` constructor,
and `pg`'s own connection-parameter parsing only recognizes a key literally named `connectionString`
for that purpose (confirmed by reading `pg`'s own source, not assumed) — an unrecognized `url` key
is silently ignored, `host`/`port`/`user`/`password`/`database` are used directly. Harmless, but
worth having actually checked instead of guessing.

**Not verified against real `docker compose`** — same sandbox limitation as EPIC23-T1/T3 (no
`docker` available here). `docker-compose.yml`'s YAML was validated for syntax (`npx js-yaml
docker-compose.yml`) and the `[hybrid]` profile's config resolution was confirmed correct in
isolation; the actual `docker compose up` → healthy `db` → `app` starts → `make db-init` → a real
request against real PostgreSQL data sequence has not been run end to end. This should be the very
first thing tried once `docker` is available.

## 6. Required Environment Variables Per Environment (EPIC23-T6)

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in real values for anything beyond plain local dev. This
table is the authoritative list — every env var the application code actually reads
(`grep -rn "process.env" modules/ infrastructure/`, not a guess):

| Variable | Required in | Default if unset | Where it's read |
|---|---|---|---|
| `JWT_SECRET` | **Always**, every environment including local dev/test | None — throws `JWT_SECRET env var is not set` | `modules/identity/infrastructure/jwt.js` |
| `GUEST_TOKEN_SECRET` | `NODE_ENV=production` only | Local/dev/test: falls back to a known, publicly-visible-in-this-repo dev value | `modules/reservation/infrastructure/guest-token.js` |
| `AUTH_PROVIDER` | Never (optional) | `local` | `infrastructure/auth/index.js` — valid values `local`/`xsuaa`/`guest` |
| `NODE_ENV` | Never strictly required, but drives everything below | unset (→ CAP's own default profile, SQLite + mocked auth) | CAP's own profile resolution (`cds.requires.[<NODE_ENV>]` in `package.json`) |
| `PORT` | Never (optional) | `4004` | CAP's built-in `cds-serve` server (no project code involved) |
| `CDS_REQUIRES_DB_CREDENTIALS_{HOST,PORT,DATABASE,USER,PASSWORD}` | `NODE_ENV=production` or `NODE_ENV=hybrid` (both use `db.kind: postgres`) | None — connection fails without them | CAP's env-var-to-config mapping, consumed by `@cap-js/postgres` |
| `POSTGRES_{DB,USER,PASSWORD}` | `docker compose up` only | `POSTGRES_DB`/`POSTGRES_USER` default to `automarket`; `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` has **no default** — compose refuses to start without it (`:?` syntax, `docker-compose.yml`) | `docker-compose.yml` only (not read by application code directly — it's what populates the `CDS_REQUIRES_DB_CREDENTIALS_*` vars passed to the `app` service) |

**A real, confirmed gap found and fixed while writing this table, not left as documentation of an
existing bug:** `GUEST_TOKEN_SECRET`'s dev fallback used to be reachable in *any* environment,
including `NODE_ENV=production` — the code comment said "must never be used in production" but
nothing actually enforced it, unlike `JWT_SECRET` in the same module family, which has always thrown
immediately if missing regardless of environment. Fixed to throw when `NODE_ENV=production` and the
env var is missing, while keeping the dev-only fallback for local `npm start`/`npm test` (no new
required env var for the common case) — confirmed via a quick Node one-liner in both configurations,
and the existing `guest-token.test.js` unit test (which runs without `NODE_ENV=production`, so still
exercises the fallback path) still passes unchanged.

**`sample.env` vs `.env.example`:** the backlog wording says "add `sample.env`" — this project
already had `.env.example` from EPIC23-T4 (the conventional name, already wired into `.gitignore`'s
`!.env.example` exception). Expanded that existing file to cover every env var above rather than
creating a second, differently-named template with overlapping purpose.
